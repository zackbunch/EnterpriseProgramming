## Course Purpose and Student Objectives

```
This course will present enterprise programming to those students who are experienced
programmers. Contemporary enterprise system development language syntax, frameworks,
and development environments will be presented and used in projects. Development project
management concepts will be discussed. Students will learn how to develop programs to
address business needs while working within established commercial software systems.
Instead of developing programs from scratch based solely on their own efforts, students will
learn how to develop programs that must operate within the bounds of existing software
systems and conform their execution to the demands of that system. The necessity of
understanding the existing system and its design framework, and then determining how best
to effect programming enhancements to meet business demands is discussed and
accomplished within projects.
```

### Course goals

- To present contemporary software development within the constraints of an already
    existing enterprise software framework
- To discuss various contemporary tools and techniques used within enterprise software
    programming.
- To examine the role of enterprise software customization and how to determine whether
    software customizing should be done.
- To provide experience at writing programs and maintaining existing programs within a
    contemporary commercial enterprise programming environment.
- To provide experience in working within a team structure on an enterprise programming
    project.

### Course Learning Outcomes

```
At the completion of this course the student is expected to be able to:
```
- Use a contemporary enterprise programming language and development environment to
    create programs to address business needs within a contemporary enterprise system.
- Use a contemporary enterprise programming language and development environment to
    maintain and/or enhance an existing program or software module within a contemporary
    enterprise system.
- Demonstrate an understanding of the role of customization and enhancement in enterprise
    programming and how to determine whether customizations or enhancements should be
    done.

## Prerequisites

```
CSCI 2910 Server-Side Programming (or equivalent programming competency) and
(CSCI 3720 Fundamentals of Business Information Systems or 5730 Enterprise Information
Systems) or permission of the instructor
```
## Graduate Content

```
As this is a dual-enrollment class, the graduate school requires that graduate students
complete substantial work distinct from the undergraduate content. Graduate students will
complete a special supplemental project as communicated separately.
```

## Available Software

```
To complete homework, students will use the SAP GUI to log in to a development
SAP ERP systems. Students are encouraged to install the SAP GUI on their own machine.
To install software on your own machine, you can find download and installation
instructions in D2L.
```
## Grading

```
Course grades will be based on a total point system, where the grade is the percent of points
earned out of the points possible. Point values will vary among class elements based on their
overall importance, complexity, or other factors. Points possible and points earned will be
shown for all assignments in the D2L gradebook. The table below provides an overview of
point opportunities in this class.
Element Points
Homework/programs 10 - 40 pts each
Quizzes 5 - 20 each
